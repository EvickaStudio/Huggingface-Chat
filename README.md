## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

\_

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

To run the application locally, please ensure the following prerequisites are met (optional when no new major features are added)

- **Python >=3.8**
- **httpx ~0.26.0**
- **configparser >=6.0.0**

### Setup Guide <a name="setup-guide"></a>

1. Download and install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Optional Virtual Environment Setup

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To do so, follow these steps:

**On Windows:**

```powershell
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On Linux / macOS:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Running Application

Execute the main script `main.py` located in the root directory:

```bash
python main.py
```

Start interacting with the AI chatbot! ðŸŽ‰

## Usage Examples <a name="usage-examples"></a>

Use the application to interactively ask questions and engage in meaningful conversations powered by Hugging Face AI models. Explore the wide range of pre-trained models available at [HuggingChat Settings](https://huggingface.co/chat/settings). (Customize the model settings in the `config.ini` file according to your preference.)

## Project Structure <a name="project-structure"></a>

The project contains the following components:

1. Backend API Wrapper
2. Configuration Management
3. Text Extraction for Response (coming soon)

Key directories and files include:

- `config.ini`: Global configuration file controlling app settings, including authentication tokens (and preferred chatbot models).
- `auth` folder: Holds scripts for accessing Hugging Face APIs and processing responses effectively.
- `utils` folder: Contains utility scripts for text extraction, configuration management, and additional tasks.
- `requirements.txt`: Provides a list of essential packages and respective versions for the proper functioning of the complete system.
